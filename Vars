Type constraints are created from a mixture of type keywords and type constructors. The supported type keywords are:

string
number
bool


variable block is made in the main.tf file and the variable is referenced using var.image_id and while executing terraform apply there will be a prompt to enter image id:

provider "aws" {
region = "us-east-2"
access_key = "AKIAIR6KNX7BJ6VIQVHA"
secret_key = "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"
}

variable "image_id" {
type = string
}



resource "aws_instance" "create_new_imst" {
ami = var.image_id
instance_type = "t2.micro"
tags = {
Name = "Created using vars"
}
}
