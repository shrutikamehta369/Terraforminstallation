Type constraints are created from a mixture of type keywords and type constructors. The supported type keywords are:

string
number
bool


variable block is made in the main.tf file and the variable is referenced using var.image_id and while executing terraform apply there will be a prompt to enter image id:

provider "aws" {
region = "us-east-2"
access_key = "AKIAIR6KNX7BJ6VIQVHA"
secret_key = "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"
}

variable "image_id" {
type = string
}



resource "aws_instance" "create_new_imst" {
ami = var.image_id
instance_type = "t2.micro"
tags = {
Name = "Created using vars"
}
}
                                                                  or
 execute terraform apply -var="var_name=var_value"
                                                                  or
provide variable values in any_name.tfvars or terraform.tfvars(automatically loaded) file and terraform apply -var-file="testing.tfvars"  

terraform.tfvars:

image_id = "ami-abc123"
availability_zone_names = [
  "us-east-1a",
  "us-west-1c",
]
